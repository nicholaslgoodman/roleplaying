diceroll
========

This group of scripts is designed to help you make a bunch of rolls
quickly, painlessly, and magically. They're perfect for rolling up new
characters (with self-defined stats if you wish), making a bunch of
quick-ready rolls, or even just rolling a whole bunch of d20s.

Use the original interactive program `diceroll.py` to make a set of dice rolls.
You really should start with this one, then you can move onto the other
flavors.

Other variants include:

1. Saving the dictionary to file: `diceroll-file.py`
2. Stripped down for quick rolls that don't need saving: `diceroll-quick.py`
3. One that only does d20 and exclaim with joy at a Crit: `diceroll-d20.py`
4. A boring one with no color or ASCII art: `diceroll-boring.py`

Enjoy!
