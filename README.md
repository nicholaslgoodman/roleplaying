roleplaying
===========

Various scripts for helping out in creating and running roleplaying game sessions.

--------

`hermit-gen.py` Generates a random hermit with an obsession, a quirk, and a secret!

`diceroll` A set of scripts to get those perfect rolls!

`inits` 3 different versions of my initiative tracker program! The subfolder `dmtools` in there 
is a "full-suite" version. Fork it! And if you want to run it, you should start with `wrapper.py`.

`namer` Makes a randomized given name for one of the Korita of the North Marches. Follows simple grammar rules, could be more sophisticated I'm sure.

`random-setting` A quick-and-dirty random setting generator. Nothing serious here, but it does get some creative juices flowing for campaign or world-building settings.
