Various scripts for helping out in creating and running roleplaying game sessions.

`hermit-gen.py` Generates a random hermit with an obsession, a quirk, and a secret!

`diceroll` A set of scripts to get those perfect rolls!

`inits` 3 different versions of my initiative tracker program! The subfolder `dmtools` in there 
is a "full-suite" version. Fork it! And if you want to run it, you should start with `wrapper.py`.
