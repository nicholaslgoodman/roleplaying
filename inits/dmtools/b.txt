campaign idea:
1st: in medias res--a boss fight!
  PCs at level 11, super buff and stuff
  (take their lvl-1 PCs and bump them up, give them some skills)
  fighting against some crazy huge blood cultist or something
  hooks and fire and pits all around
  he's got a couple helpers
  one of the PCs is bound on an altar in the middle
  the party comes to break him out
  fight, etc etc
  eventually all KO'd, end of fight (defeat! game over! or is it???)
  wake up in chains--on neck, hands, feet
  slaves to the cultists with kobold overseers
  also totally depowered and wearing rags
  now they're lvl 1 again

2nd: at the slave camp
  getting the digs of the place
    meet some slave buddies
  different PCs in different chain gangs
    (latrine duty, wood chopping, brick making, field plowing, etc)
  share communal quarters under the monastery with ~200 other slaves
  plot a breakout
    need a map of the place so the PCs can get the layout
    need to establish some routines
    need to make some amicable NPCs
    need to make some hostile slaves
      will have a gang fight--lvl 1 skills, all hand to hand unless someone finds a shiv or something
    need to plan a few ways out with encs--overseers, cultists, skills, etc
    save friends? save all? sneak out? use friends as bait? which way to run?

3rd: on the road again
  caravan - Torane Zobeida (see notebook)

4th: Haverton

5th?: Umrae's Spire

6th?: N to Ralidor, S to Baedric's Keep and the War, E to Grandalton and the coast, W into the mountains and Lake Asab
